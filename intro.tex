\section{Introduction}

The \uboone detector is a large-scale liquid argon time projection chamber \cite{detector-paper}.  It has been running since 2015, and filled with cold liquid argon for nearly two years at the time of this publication.  In late January 2017, the detector high voltage was ramped down to 0kV in response to problems that were being observed.  After four weeks of tests, diagnostics and downtime the cause of the high voltage problems was decisively found to be a poor connection between the high voltage feed-through and the cup it is inserted to that connects to the cathode.

In this document, we present a summary of the design of \uboone's high voltage system (Section~\ref{sec:HV-design}), as well as a discussion of the symptoms observed in the detector that lead to the conclusion that the high voltage system had a problem (Section~\ref{sec:symptoms}).  Further, we describe the tests we performed to narrow down on the source of the problem (Section~\ref{sec:diagnostics}) and the resolution and lessons learned from this situation (Section~\ref{sec:resolution}).
